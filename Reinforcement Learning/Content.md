## Breif of Reinforcement Learning (RL)
	RL through taking suitable action to maximize reward score in formulated problem. Comparing with supervised learning, there is no correct answer key. 
	key: Empty brain(model or not)-> experience(like activation function) -> devised action

## Method type 
1. Model free or Model based [more info](https://medium.com/the-official-integrate-ai-blog/understanding-reinforcement-learning-93d4e34e5698)
	Model free: emphasize learning through current state
	Model based: emphasize planning through current state (forming imagination)
2. Policy based or Value based [more info](https://towardsdatascience.com/policy-based-reinforcement-learning-the-easy-way-8de9a3356083)
	policy based: percentage decide action
	value based: value decide action
	
3. Monte-Carlo update or Temporal diffirence update [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_difference_learning)
	Monte-Carlo Update:updating depend on once the final outcome known 
	Temporal difirence update: updating depend on every step estimation 

4. On policy or Off policy [more](https://leimao.github.io/blog/RL-On-Policy-VS-Off-Policy/)	
	On-Policy: update policy differenc to the behavior policy
	Off-Policy: update policy same as behavior policy

## The reason to use
1. RL behavior without supervisor
 more blank

## preparation
1. Numpy or Pandas : statistics analysis
2. Matplotlib: statistics visualization
3. Tkinter or OpenAI gym: simulated environment
4. tensorflow: neural network puls with RL
